## Contributing guidelines (short)

This project prioritizes privacy, offline-first behavior, and clean repository hygiene. A few quick rules to help maintainers and contributors:

- Do not commit build outputs or generated artifacts. These can contain platform-specific absolute paths and other environment data that break CI or other developers' builds.
- Run tests through the provided test bootstrap so platform plugins are replaced with test doubles. See `app/test/test_runner.dart` and `app/test/test_setup.dart`.

How to remove accidentally committed build outputs

1. Identify the tracked files. For example:

   git ls-files | grep "\bapp/build\b" || true

2. Remove them from the repository while keeping them locally:

   git rm --cached -r app/build/
   git commit -m "chore: remove tracked build outputs from repo"

3. Push the commit to your branch. The CI guard (see below) will prevent build outputs from being tracked going forward.

CI guard: tracked build outputs

We added a CI workflow that fails if files under common build output locations are still tracked (for example: `app/build/`, `build/`, `.dart_tool/`). If the guard fails on your PR, remove the tracked outputs as shown above and push the fix.

Running tests

Use the repository test runner which applies the test bootstrap that injects test doubles and mocks for platform plugins:

  dart run test:test_runner.dart

If you need to run individual tests, ensure you call `initTestBootstrap()` first or run them via the provided test runner.

Thanks for contributing â€” small changes and tests are welcome. If you're unsure, open a draft PR and request a review.
# Contributing to blurapp

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines:

## Pull Requests
- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- PRs must pass `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` for all flavors.
- Include tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Document public APIs with Dartdoc if non-obvious.

## Code Style
- Run `dart format .` before submitting.
- Use meaningful names and null-safety everywhere.
- Prefer composition over inheritance; keep functions < 50 lines.
- Avoid magic numbers and "god" widgets/services.

## Testing
- Add unit tests for pure functions in `test/unit/`.
- Add widget tests for UI in `test/widget/`.
- Ensure coverage for blur logic, file IO, and mask ops.

## Review Process
- PRs are reviewed for code quality, test coverage, and adherence to architecture.
- Large or untested feature drops will be rejected.

## Other Notes
- No network permissions, analytics, or ads.
- All processing must be offline.
- See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for architecture and conventions.

## Build artifacts

Please do not commit build outputs or IDE caches (for example any `build/` directories under `app/`, `android/`, `ios/`, `build/`, or platform plugin folders). These files are machine-specific and can break CI (they may include absolute paths or platform-specific binaries).

To clean and rebuild locally:

```bash
# remove local build outputs
flutter clean

# fetch packages and run analyzer/tests
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test

# build the Android debug APK locally
flutter build apk --debug
```

If you find machine-specific files accidentally committed, remove them from the index and push a commit:

```bash
git rm -r --cached path/to/committed/build_dir
git commit -m "ci: remove committed build artifacts"
git push origin your-branch
```
