# TensorFlow Lite Integration Summary

## Implementation Complete ✅

### What was implemented

1. **AutoDetectService with full TensorFlow Lite integration**:
   - Face detection using MediaPipe's `face_detection_short_range.tflite`
   - Background segmentation using MediaPipe's `selfie_segmentation.tflite`
   - Complete preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing pipeline
   - Proper tensor handling with correct input/output shapes

2. **Editor Screen Integration**:
   - "Detect Faces" button for automatic face detection
   - "Detect Background" button for foreground/background segmentation
   - Error handling with user-friendly SnackBar feedback
   - Integration with existing manual mask editing workflow

3. **Technical Details**:
   - **Face Detection**: BlazeFace model (128x128 input), outputs bounding boxes for detected faces
   - **Segmentation**: Selfie segmentation model (256x256 input), outputs per-pixel foreground/background mask
   - **Preprocessing**: Automatic image resizing and normalization (RGB to [-1,1] for faces, [0,1] for segmentation)
   - **Postprocessing**: Confidence thresholding, coordinate scaling, mask generation

### Models Downloaded and Ready

- `face_detection_short_range.tflite` (229KB) - MediaPipe BlazeFace model
- `selfie_segmentation.tflite` (244KB) - MediaPipe selfie segmentation model

### Usage Flow

1. **Load Image**: Pick from gallery or camera
2. **Auto-Detection**:
   - Tap "Detect Faces" to automatically find and mask face regions
   - Tap "Detect Background" to automatically mask background areas
3. **Manual Editing**: Fine-tune masks with brush tools if needed
4. **Apply Blur**: Choose blur type and strength
5. **Export/Share**: Save result to device or share

### Code Architecture

- `AutoDetectService`: Clean abstraction for TensorFlow Lite inference
- `DetectionType` enum: Distinguishes between face detection and segmentation models
- `PainterMask`: Updated to support both manual strokes and ML-generated masks
- Error handling: Graceful degradation with informative error messages

### Technical Achievements

- ✅ Complete MediaPipe TFLite model integration
- ✅ Automatic tensor shape handling and data preprocessing
- ✅ Memory efficient image processing
- ✅ Non-blocking UI with proper async handling
- ✅ Clean separation between ML inference and UI logic
- ✅ Type-safe enum-based model selection

The TensorFlow Lite functionality is now fully "wired in" and ready for testing with real images!

## Next Steps for User

1. Run the app: `flutter run`
2. Test face detection with photos containing faces
3. Test background segmentation with selfie-style photos
4. Combine auto-detection with manual mask editing for precision control

All core ML functionality is implemented and integrated into the Flutter blur app workflow.
