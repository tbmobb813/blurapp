2025-09-24T00:35:36.6242859Z Potential fix: Your project's gradle version is typically defined in the gradle wrapper file. By default, this can be found at /home/runner/work/blurapp/blurapp/app/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties.

2025-09-24T00:35:36.6283685Z Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/home/runner/work/blurapp/blurapp/app/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
2025-09-24T00:35:36.6287031Z If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (/home/runner/work/blurapp/blurapp/app/android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".
